					<h2>Plot</h2>
					<p class="parrafo">
						The game's first few moments are seen in a first-person view through the eyes of a Hunter; who sees he is being operated on by an old man. The man explains that he is performing a blood transfusion, and tells the Hunter they've "come to the right place" in seeking Paleblood.[37] He warns the Hunter that he will go on a strange journey that will seem like a bad dream.

						<h2>The Old Hunters</h2>
					<p class="parrafo">
						After discovering an item called "Eye of a Blood-Drunk Hunter", the player learns of the Hunter's Nightmare, where the first hunters are trapped, drunk with blood. While traveling through Yharnam, the player comes across the corpse of a strange Hunter. When the player searches the corpse, they are pulled into the Hunter's Nightmare, populated by both beasts and long-crazed Hunters, by a lesser Amygdala. The player meets Simon the Harrowed Hunter, who tells them how the nightmare serves as a prison for hunters who have succumbed to their own madness and the scourge, and that the nightmare hides a dangerous secret. He then assists the player throughout their travels. 
						<br><br>
						The player first heads to the Nightmare Church, where they encounter and kill the first of the Church Hunters and the founder of the Healing Church Workshop, Ludwig the Accursed, who is also responsible for the creation of the Hunt, having conceived of it as a way to boost the morale of the citizens of Yharnam before it spiraled out of control. The player can then choose either to tell the dying Ludwig of what has become of the Church and Yharnam, or else lie and let him die happy. The player can also kill the founder of the Healing Church, Laurence the First Vicar, after finding his human skull.
